**1. OOPS:**

_Introduction:_ </br>
    OOPS (Object oriented programming) is a paradigm rooted in the principle of deriving software behavior from real-world entities.
    Instead of dividing a program into data structure and functions as i Procedural Programming, OOP treats data as object that have inherent characteristics and behaviours.

_Advantages of OOPs:_</br>
    Modularity: Objects stored in different files and modules, promoting reusibility.
    Reusability: Inheritance allows new objects to take property of existing ones , reducing redundancy.
    Easy Debugging.
    Maintenance.

_►Classes:</br>_
     A blueprint for creating object. It defines data type by bundling data and methods
```
class Student{
    private String name;
    private int age;

    //Constructor:
    public Student (String name, int age){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public void printName(){
        System.out.println("Name: " + this.name);
    }    
}
```
_►Objects:</br>_
    An instance of a clas. If student is class then object John is object (instance) of that class
```
Student john = new Student("John", 24) 
```
_►Encapsulation:_
Encapsulation is mechanism of restricting access to certain details and showing only essential features.
Its like a medical capsule that holds various medicins inside while protecting it from external environment.

```
class Student{
    private String name;//Encapsulation if attributes
    private int age;

    //Constructor:
    public Student (String name, int age){ // Public method tos et up the attributes
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public void printName(){ // Public method to get the name attribiutes
        System.out.println("Name: " + this.name);
    }    
}
```

_►Inheritance:_
Inheritance is a mechanism where the new class is derived from existing class. 
The new class is known as subclass, inherits the attributes and behaviour(methods) from the parent class.

```
class GraduatedStudent extends Student{
    private String batch;

    public void setBatchName(String batch){
        this.batch = batch;
    }

    public void getBatchName(){
        System.out.println("Batch name: " + this.batch);
    }
}

//Creating object of inherited class

GraducatedStudent alice = new Student("Alice" , 23);//Constructor inherited from parents.
alice.setBatchName("WEB15");//setBatchName method of subclass

```

_►Polymorphism:_
Ploymorphism allows methods to do differnt things based on the object it is acting upon.
```
class Animal{
    public void makeSound(){
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal{
    public void makeSound(){
        System.out.println("Dog Barks");
    }
}
```

_►Abstraction:_
Abstraction is a concept of hiding complex reality while exposing only necessary parts.
It simplifies the complex details to ease user interaction with the system.

For example, when you drive a car you dont need to know the complexity of internal combustion or engine. You just need to drive a car.
```
abstract class Car{
    abstract void accelerate();
    abstract void brake();
}

class Sedan extends Car{
    void accelerate(){
         System.out.println("Sedan is accelerating");
    }

    void brake(){
         System.out.println("Sedan is braking");
    }
}
```
